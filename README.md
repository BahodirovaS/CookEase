## What is CookEase?

CookEase is a recipe search application that allows users to search for recipes based on their dietary preferences and be able to view their details. Said dietary preferences include the user's diet, allergies or intolerances, ingredients they want to use, the amount of time they want to spend on the recipe, and how many searches they want to populate the search page. Some additional features users are able to see when viewing a recipe include health scores, price per serving, and nutritional information. In addition to searching for recipes, authenticated users are able to favorite recipes and save them to their account.

Using a NoSQL database, MongoDB, the backend was built using PyMongo and the FastAPI web framework. This application includes a user authentication feature which is built using JWTDown for FASTAPI, and uses a third-party api service, Spoonacular API, to search for recipes. In order to create a responsive and interactive interface, the frontend was built using Javascript and RTK Query. In terms of frontend design, Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons were used with CSS to create a pleasant and friendly user experience.
