    Today, my group and I worked on writing the code for user authentication. The group decided to continue to work on the project all together instead of breaking up, so we broke up days each of us will lead. I led today as the active coder and everyone one else communicated with me their research/ what Learn advised. I tried to run Docker to see if the database would run, but my computer started to crash so we didn't get to that part.
    As we were filling out our docker-compose.yaml file, I was finally able to read that file and understand what each line means.

    Looking at our wireframe as a template, api designs were made for 13 endpoints in the docs/api-design.md file. I made a keys.py to store my API keys, and put it outside the sample_service directory then added it to .gitignore so it doesn't push to the main branch. A question that came up was how we wanted to format our response when making a call, more specifically whether or not we should include ingredient list or steps in our returns.
