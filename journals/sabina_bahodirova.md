    Today, we were working on our favorites endpoints to be able to favorite a recipe, without realizing that we had to have a recipe before we could favorite it. So we switched over to the recipes.py in both queries and routers to pull recipes from our third party api. Using Riley's code as a guide, we wrote out our recipe queries and router functions. We encountered errors with importing our API keys using the .env file, and couldn't resolve them, so we ended up putting them in a directory called keys inside the cookease directory to import into our queries folder. An unknown error came up and we realized an "&" symbol must be before a string when concatenating to the url as a query parameter. Once we were able to get recipes using our query parameters, we switched over to working on our favorites function again and came accross an error with ids. We will hopefully squash that bug tomorrow.

    Today, we worked on and completed the user authentication endpoints. We wrote the functions to get and create an account in the AccountQueries class, ran into docker issues but rebuilding the entire container including the volume solved that issue. Afterwards, we were able to successfully use all the token endpoints, the /queries/accounts and /api/launch-details endpoints. We were also able to successfully make a call for the /cookease/favorites GET protected endpoint, but are still working on the POST and DELETE endpoints for our favorites. One aha moment was realizing that the docker volume may have previous users saved with errors so that when we fix the code and make another call, that previos user would still be showing the error. We fixed this by deleting the mongo-data volume and rebuilding the entier docker container.

    Today, my group and I worked on writing the code for user authentication. The group decided to continue to work on the project all together instead of breaking up, so we broke up days each of us will lead. I led today as the active coder and everyone one else communicated with me their research/ what Learn advised. I tried to run Docker to see if the database would run, but my computer started to crash so we didn't get to that part.
    As we were filling out our docker-compose.yaml file, I was finally able to read that file and understand what each line means.

    Looking at our wireframe as a template, api designs were made for 13 endpoints in the docs/api-design.md file. I made a keys.py to store my API keys, and put it outside the sample_service directory then added it to .gitignore so it doesn't push to the main branch. A question that came up was how we wanted to format our response when making a call, more specifically whether or not we should include ingredient list or steps in our returns.
