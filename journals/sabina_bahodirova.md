    I am not able to get the ingredient widget in the back end because the content-type is text/html and I'm not sure if it's possible to convert it to application/json. Might attempt to make a call in the frontend in the future to test it out. Today, we all worked on the favorite recipe page and struggled with getting the favorites we made in the backend to populate the page. Our mistake was that we were populating the GET favorite endpoint with random ids that weren't from the api, so we weren't able to fetch our favorites and have it show in our favorites queries, therefore couldn't get the page to load without errors. We made a recipe card that held information on how a recipe shows and passed that as a prop after updating the favorites backend and were finally able to pull favorites from our backend and have them show up in our frontend. We also made a logout function so users can easily logout once logged in. We are now trying to make a like button that allows users to add recipes to their favorites page, but are getting errors saying our FormData doesn't accept certain parameters. We will continute to work on this tomorrow.

    We figured out the search component! We used the lazy data hook redux has in its toolbox. We also removed the required fiels in front-end so we only need maxReadyTime. We moved on to the component that shows recipe details once the recipe title is clicked in the search page, and realized our data loads only sometimes...so we added an isLoading if/else statement since our data wasn't loading when it was called. I wanted to add an ingredient widget our api provides, but I am not sure how to convert the response content-type from text/html to application/json.

    Still can't get the search component to load any data, we tried adding async/away, tried changing up our redux queries in the apiSlice function, tried importing the getRecipe query from the apiSlice different ways, still couldn't figure it out. Braeden and Tyler stayed after class to figure it out. Not sure if we tied our backend and front-end correctly, but it might be that our data is loading after it is called, so we are getting undefined.

    The Nav bar and main page load corrently! Our problem was not that we were using modal instead of bootstrap, one line of code had a container name that bootstrap didn't recognize so we added a "my" in front of it. Also had to add a color scheme to the nav bar so the hamburger icon showed when we pulled up localhost. Moving on, we all tried to get the search recipe to return an array of recipes, but still kept getting undefined. Plus, some of our code was throwing errors such as "getRecipe is not a function". Spent pretty much the rest of the day trying new things and researching, so hopefully we get it tomorrow.

    Today, we worked on user authentication in the front end using RTK. We made an auth folder to store the react redux applications then used them to create our login and signup forms. We then wanted to create a nav bar to temporarily store our routes to test whether they worked. An issue we ran into was whether or not we should use bootstrap, since we made our login and signup forms using modals. When I tested the routes out after including bootstrap in our public/index.html file, the forms weren't loading and we realized it was because we didn't write them for bootstrap. Therefore, we now have to update our LogIn.js and SignUp.js to be compatible with bootsrap.

    Today, we finished the function that creates a new favorite and we are able to get a list of all our favorites. I struggled because I was getting an empty array instead of a return body that looks like our model, but resolved that issue when I created a get_favorite function that gets one favorite before creating it. We then started working on a delete function for favorites, but our delete function is only working if we hard code the ObjectId for each favorite. We are struggling with getting our code to delete a function using the id we pass in (ex 1, or 2 instead of the 12 digit hex code). My aha moment for today was getting the delete function to delete a favorite from our favorites list; the delete endpoint was working but the list still showed the favorited recipe that we wanted to delete, so I changed "_id" to "recipe_id" in the delete_one method.

    Today, we were working on our favorites endpoints to be able to favorite a recipe, without realizing that we had to have a recipe before we could favorite it. So we switched over to the recipes.py in both queries and routers to pull recipes from our third party api. Using Riley's code as a guide, we wrote out our recipe queries and router functions. We encountered errors with importing our API keys using the .env file, and couldn't resolve them, so we ended up putting them in a directory called keys inside the cookease directory to import into our queries folder. An unknown error came up and we realized an "&" symbol must be before a string when concatenating to the url as a query parameter. Once we were able to get recipes using our query parameters, we switched over to working on our favorites function again and came accross an error with ids. We will hopefully squash that bug tomorrow.

    Today, we worked on and completed the user authentication endpoints. We wrote the functions to get and create an account in the AccountQueries class, ran into docker issues but rebuilding the entire container including the volume solved that issue. Afterwards, we were able to successfully use all the token endpoints, the /queries/accounts and /api/launch-details endpoints. We were also able to successfully make a call for the /cookease/favorites GET protected endpoint, but are still working on the POST and DELETE endpoints for our favorites. One aha moment was realizing that the docker volume may have previous users saved with errors so that when we fix the code and make another call, that previos user would still be showing the error. We fixed this by deleting the mongo-data volume and rebuilding the entier docker container.

    Today, my group and I worked on writing the code for user authentication. The group decided to continue to work on the project all together instead of breaking up, so we broke up days each of us will lead. I led today as the active coder and everyone one else communicated with me their research/ what Learn advised. I tried to run Docker to see if the database would run, but my computer started to crash so we didn't get to that part.
    As we were filling out our docker-compose.yaml file, I was finally able to read that file and understand what each line means.

    Looking at our wireframe as a template, api designs were made for 13 endpoints in the docs/api-design.md file. I made a keys.py to store my API keys, and put it outside the sample_service directory then added it to .gitignore so it doesn't push to the main branch. A question that came up was how we wanted to format our response when making a call, more specifically whether or not we should include ingredient list or steps in our returns.
