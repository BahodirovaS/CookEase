-Finished a few functions, can GET a list of favorites, as well as POST a favorite to our list of favorites.
-Tried to start on the DEL function of favorites to remove a favorites from the list, but ran into some blockers. Got it to work by hard coding in the 12 digit hex code id
but we don't know how to grab the string id with a variable. Tried to change it to use recipe id instead of the long str but we couldn't figure that out either.
