## February 16th, 2023

-Finished a few functions, can GET a list of favorites, as well as POST a favorite to our list of favorites.
-Tried to start on the DEL function of favorites to remove a favorites from the list, but ran into some blockers. Got it to work by hard coding in the 12 digit hex code id
but we don't know how to grab the string id with a variable. Tried to change it to use recipe id instead of the long str but we couldn't figure that out either.
-> Braeden/Benjamin main drivers

## February 21st, 2023

-Started work on get recipe details function. Got it to work and finished it. Will use this function to get all information from spoonacular API and filter it in the front end
-Talked with Candice a bit and figured out our delete function that we left off was correct and working as intended and will incorporate rest in frontend

# February 22nd, 2023

-Started work on frontend auth, we got it to work was able to double check that user was created as well as be able to log in by using FASTapi, also FASTapi returns token.
-Unsure how to use this token in the front end and how it all works, but it works with the backend for the time being
