## February 9th 2023
- We worked on our API design and getting our route ideas set up
- We used the Spoonacular API as reference for our API design

# February 16th 2023
- We worked on our favorites python files for our routers and queries
- We got it to work for creating and getting a recipe
- Delete only works if we hardcode the specific long id
  but that is not what we want since we want to access these properties dynamically
- Goal next is to figure out how to delete a favorite with a dynamic input id that is not the hashed string
