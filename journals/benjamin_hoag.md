- We began the authentication process for our project by following along with Curtis and the video on learn on how to create our database and the authentication process.
- We installed jwtdown fastapi.
- We read through the project advice on learn and implemented what we needed for our database.

- We finished getting docker up and running (that took a long time because we had to find little bugs in the code).
- We got all of the swagger end points up and running.

- We were working on the "get all favorites" end point only to realize that it will not work until we have recipes in the data base.
-We switched over to getting data from our third party api and keep hitting errors.
-We hit a stopping point after we were able to get recipes and we will pick up there tomorrow.
