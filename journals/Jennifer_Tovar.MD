Today we cloned the repository and added the keys.py file to the cookease directory to store our api keys. We added our api keys to gitignore. We added the api-design.md file to the docs directory and added the api endpoints to the file. We reviewed our wireframe and made sure that it was completed. We completed the endpoints for our api.

Today we modified our wireframe and our api endpoints with Riley's help. We read the D1: FastApi and RDBMSes on learn to learn more about what type of database we want to use for our project.

Today we created our database and began the authentication process for our project. We read through the project advice on learn and implemented what we needed for our database. We installed jwtdown fastapi. We then followed along with Curtis and the video he provided on how to create our database and the authentication process. We decided to complete the authentication process tomorrow so that we can continue our learning on some of the stuff that we were confused about.

Today I was on the driver seat for our coding and programming time. We got docker up and running after Riley helped us solve a 500 server error that we were trying to debug for over two hours. That was exciting to get fixed. Now our docker is up and running successfully without any other errors. Once docker was up and running, we were able to test our login, logout, and get a favorite on Swagger. We saw 200 codes witch was great! We completed our authentication! And during the rest of the time left, we were working on posting a favorite function. We are still not sure how to complete the function or the class but we will figure it out tomorrow. Today was a successful day!
