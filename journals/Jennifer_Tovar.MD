    Today we started the frontend application for our project. It was a successful day as we completed the authentication for the frontend. We now have a signup page, a login page, a navigation page, an App page, a Main page and an Index page. We can signup a user and login successfully. We have a nav bar on the main page. My aha moment was when we realized that we all have to install redux. The website will not work without it being installed. Tomorrow we will tackle incorporating bootstrap to the signup and login page.

    Today was my turn to be on the driver seat. We started the day with some blockers from Thursday, with our delete function not working. We fixed our delete function so that our delete endpoint would work to delete a favorite recipe by resetting the code back to what it was on Thursday. My aha moment was when Candice helped me realize that we were trying to delete the wrong id(recipe_id) for our delete endpoint and when our function was working, we were actually deleting the correct id(ObjectId), which was the id from spoonacular that was auto generated but we were trying to change it to delete the wrong id(recipe_id). We completed the recipe details endpoint and tested it to make sure it worked and it did! We are offically done with backend!!! We began to read the learn explorations for React to be ready to start the frontend tomorrow.

    Today, we finished the function that creates a new favorite and the favorite list of all of our favorites. We started working on a delete function to delete a recipe that was favorited, but our delete function is only working if we hard code the ObjectId for each favorite. We are struggling with getting our code to delete a saved favorite using the recipe_id we pass in (ex 1, or 2 instead of the 12 digit id that gets generated for us by spoonacular). We will pick up the delete function/endpoint on Tuesday.

    Today I was on the driver seat for our coding and programming time. We got docker up and running after Riley helped us solve a 500 internal server error that we were trying to debug for over two hours. That was exciting to get fixed and my aha moment because I realized with Riley's help that when we get an internal server error, it usually means that something in my code was changed after I had submitted or saved it in the browser(Swagger). Once the changed was saved and the code was changed, the computer still had the previous saved input, which was throwing that internal error. In order to fix that I needed to delete all of my docker containers, images and volumes and re-build everything back up. Once that was deleted and re-built, the error was gone! Now our docker is up and running successfully without any other errors. Once docker was up and running, we were able to test our login, logout, and get a favorite on Swagger. We saw 200 codes witch was great! We completed our authentication! And during the rest of the time left, we were working on posting a favorite function. We are still not sure how to complete the function or the class but we will figure it out tomorrow. Today was a successful day!

    Today we created our database and began the authentication process for our project. We read through the project advice on learn and implemented what we needed for our database. We installed jwtdown fastapi. We then followed along with Curtis and the video he provided on how to create our database and the authentication process. We decided to complete the authentication process tomorrow so that we can continue our learning on some of the stuff that we were confused about.

    Today we modified our wireframe and our api endpoints with Riley's help. We read the D1: FastApi and RDBMSes on learn to learn more about what type of database we want to use for our project.

    Today we cloned the repository and added the keys.py file to the cookease directory to store our api keys. We added our api keys to gitignore. We added the api-design.md file to the docs directory and added the api endpoints to the file. We reviewed our wireframe and made sure that it was completed. We completed the endpoints for our api.
